"Response number","How would you rate your agreement with the following statement: I enjoyed learning R as part of this module.","At this point in the course, how would you rate your anxiety levels around using R for statistical analysis?","How could the materials be improved to help you gain more confidence/reduce any anxiety around using R? "
1,"Neither agree nor disagree","Not particularly anxious","I am currently fine with the work we have been given at the moment."
2,"Strongly agree","Very anxious","copies of r scripts to compare our own r scripts to to see where we are going wrong"
3,Agree,"Not particularly anxious","Everything is fine"
4,"Strongly agree","Not at all anxious","I don&#039;t know what could be improved to help using R."
5,"Strongly agree","Not particularly anxious","more examples of each type of question"
6,"Neither agree nor disagree","Not particularly anxious","I think the only way I can get more confident is if I practise using it more. I think the materials we have are helpful."
7,"Neither agree nor disagree","Not particularly anxious","Provide more worked examples of questions using R"
8,Agree,Anxious,"Going over the syntax of R and explaining what is happening behind the scenes of R"
9,Agree,"Not particularly anxious","More aid with learning to import modules and CSV files"
10,"Strongly agree","Not particularly anxious",
11,"Strongly agree","Not particularly anxious","everything is fine"
12,Agree,"Not particularly anxious","They couldn&#039;t be improved any further. They are genuinely fantastic."
13,"Strongly agree","Not particularly anxious","video on each section to show it being typed into R"
14,Agree,"Not particularly anxious","i have found the materials that have been provided very helpful when using R as well as the support from the lecturers."
15,Agree,"Not particularly anxious","Maybe a help sheet guide resource with all of the commands we should know and their purposes?"
16,Disagree,"Very anxious",.
17,"Strongly disagree","Not particularly anxious",N/A
18,Agree,"Not particularly anxious","I think the materials are effective in helping me understand how to use R, especially the quizzes."
19,"Strongly agree","Not particularly anxious","The only thing I’d say is maybe me more videos on what could go wrong when using R and the solutions on how to fix these common problems."
20,"Strongly agree","Not particularly anxious",Nothing
21,Agree,"Not particularly anxious","videos in using R"
22,Agree,"Not particularly anxious","I can&#039;t think of that much, but what might be useful is if you sent in a tutorial sheet involving R to give us something to work on during tutorials a it feels like a lot of the time students aren&#039;t sure what to get on with during the tutorials as there isn&#039;t a specific worksheet to get us familiar with R. Apart from that I think it&#039;s fine."
23,Agree,"Not particularly anxious","I feel the materials given are sufficient ,although some times its easier to follow through when watching a video demonstration"
24,"Neither agree nor disagree","Not particularly anxious","Nothing in particular just more practice would improve confidence for me"
25,"Strongly agree","Not at all anxious","The way the materials are laid out and organised already is really helpful"
26,Agree,"Not at all anxious","More visual representations maybe but i am feeling fine with r"
27,"Strongly agree","Not at all anxious",N/A
28,"Strongly agree","Not particularly anxious","I enjoy having weekly quizes where I get results straight away.i find it very effective and helps my learning"
29,Agree,"Not particularly anxious","Potentially more time spent in weekly zoom tutorials going over r codes and common errors in R/ how to resolve them"
30,"Strongly agree",Anxious,"I don&#039;t think there is much to do to help, just me working on it"
31,Agree,"Not at all anxious","more videos on how to use R, for example, the first week with mean, mode and median and inputting csv files."
32,Agree,"Not particularly anxious","Practice more during the tutorials"
33,Agree,"Not particularly anxious","more examples"
34,"Strongly disagree","Not particularly anxious","Exercises about past R topics in future weeks i.e. Include stuff learn in Week 1 in Week 5 quiz."
35,Agree,"Not particularly anxious","possibly more video tutorials for R just to know how to use the new commands when we learn them before completing the quizzes on the topics"
36,Agree,"Not particularly anxious","Maybe one or two more worked examples for each function."
37,"Neither agree nor disagree",Anxious,"More practice with importing sata sets"
38,"Strongly agree","Not particularly anxious","Videos talking through questions on R"
39,Agree,Anxious,"I don&#039;t really see any way in which they can be, maybe a couple of tutorials using more difficult questions from areas in the course using R to help people understand it better, apart from that I&#039;m not sure there&#039;s anything much more to be done to help my understanding of R."
40,"Strongly disagree",Anxious,"Include more worked examples of using R and inputting code into R."
41,"Neither agree nor disagree",Anxious,Nothing
42,Agree,Anxious,"More example questions"
43,Agree,"Not at all anxious",N/A
44,Agree,"Not particularly anxious","Materials are helpful with the use of R. Maybe a drop-in could be dedicated solely to the use of R every two weeks."
45,Agree,"Not particularly anxious",-
46,Agree,"Not particularly anxious","Possibly more worked examples like a question then how it’s answered in r and what what the result should come out to be"
47,Agree,"Not particularly anxious","more examples"
48,Agree,"Not particularly anxious","Examples for everything. Maybe a R file with all of the functions we have used to refer back to if Stuck."
