15,Agree,Not particularly anxious,I love learning R because its different from just doing maths.the last couple of quizzes have been complicated but I&#039;ve recieved loads of help.
16,Strongly agree,Not at all anxious,I am so far really enjoying this module and especially the way that it is laid out. It is made very clear what work students should complete every week and makes it easy to track your own progress with the constant quizzes which I think is crucial in identifying areas we need to improve in.

39,Agree,Not particularly anxious,"I am a fan of the structure of the my place page, including the amount of examples you can work through. However sometimes it can be annoying that you are only given the correct answer when you have got a question wrong in the quiz instead of being shown the correct code of how to get it."

42,Agree,Anxious,
43,Agree,Not at all anxious,I have really enjoyed the prospect of being able to use R as when I did Statistics last year I had to look up everything in a list from a book and it made it a lot harder! Using R is far quicker and I would obviously be lying if I said that I got it right away but it helped me to be able to see the data more visually much quicker and also certain tests R is able to do by itself which is really efficient. A lot of the course I have already looked at last year but it&#039;s good revision. I also enjoyed the Group Project as I felt like I was seen as an important member of the group just like everyone else and everyone took my suggestions seriously even though some of them may have been a bit far fetched! Looking forward to the next semester!
